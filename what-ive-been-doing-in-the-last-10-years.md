title: What I've been doing in the last 10 years

This week I dedicate myself to update my resumÃ¨ and I have the brilliant idea of put into it my technical historical, what resuming is a list of things I did or was involved with during my brief ten years stay in the programming world.

So I thought: "this could be useful to the people read me". Why not? Perhaps you got some doubt waiting to be solved and is unable to find a guy who knows something about this. Perhaps this f* guy even exists and has a blog where he could share some knowledge that is stuck in that empty programmer head.

In this case, it follows bellow a brief description of my professional life, with the things I could remember I did since December 2000. What I haven't remember probably is not worth of.

	
  * Software and hardware inventory

	
  * Clipboard and PrintScreen protection using windows hooks and global messages manipulation

	
  * Driver writing system event log

	
  * DeviceIoControl user/kernel communication

	
  * Desktop remote control using VNC technique

	
  * Remote execution tool PsExec (SysInternals) like

	
  * Print control using regex (Boost) and shell hook

	
  * Access policies management during user logon/logoff (register and hooks)

	
  * Datgabase migration CTree -> SQL (OLE classes)

	
  * Windows authentication using custom GINA and DCOM; Credential Provider (Vista)

	
  * CTree database synchronism using custom DCOM service

	
  * Bootable Linux CD with bash scripts and disk cryptography tools using C language

	
  * Hard disk encryption and PenDrive (USB) storage control

	
  * Blue Screen analysis using memory dumps and WinDbg live (Gflags)

	
  * System account execution using custom COM service

	
  * MBR (Master Boot Record) customization library

	
  * Blowfish/SHA-1 encryption library using C++ and 16 bits Assembly

	
  * Log access driver using shared memory between user and kernel mode

	
  * Kernel mode API hook for 9X and NT platforms

	
  * 16 bits Assembly loader; debugging using debug.com tool

	
  * Executable protection using embedded domain authentication recorded inside files resources

	
  * Internet Explorer 6/7 and Firefox 1/2 browsing protection using Assembly 32 bits code injection

	
  * Code, strings and execution protection library (using Win32 interruptions)

	
  * Centralized log generation library using shared memory and global events

	
  * Internet Explorer 6/7 BHO (Broser Helper Object) and ActiveX; Mozilla/Firefox XPI plugin

	
  * Projects management using Source Safe, Bazaar and Batch (Win) scripts

	
  * Kernel mode debugging using SoftIce and WinDbg for NT platform, SoftIce and WDeb98 for 9X platform

	
  * Trojans reverse engineering (C++, Visual Basic, Delphi) using WinDbg and IDA

	
  * Diagnostic tool listing files, services, drivers, register, disk partitions, processes, etc

	
  * Jobs monitoring in Win2000+ to installation and update control

	
  * Application use monitoring using noninvasive and invasive windows hooks

	
  * Houaiss reverse engineering and Babylon importation (dictionaries)

	
  * Build control with Cruise Control .NET, symbol server with Debugging Tools

	
  * Projects documentation using Doxygen and Wiki (Trac)

	
  * Management interfaces using C++ Builder 5/6 and Visual C++ custom libraries

	
  * E-mails analyzer using regular expressions (ATL classes)

	
  * Configuration interfaces using Visual C++ (MFC /ATL/WTL)

	
  * Project and tracing analysis using regular expressions (Vim and Grep)

	
  * Articles development using technical blog and Code Project community.

Perhaps I update this list frequently. Although I guess the rightest choice would be to update the list with articles about my every day "brushing bits" life . After all, I got a technical blog already!
