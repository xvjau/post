Second, because of this epistemic primacy of existence, she regards perception as the base of knowledge and as self-evident (for perception is the direct awareness of external existents). Whereas Kant argued that since a priori knowledge exists, it must be the case that reality conforms to our minds, Rand argues conversely: since reality does not have to conform to our minds (but rather the reverse is the case), there can not be a priori knowledge -- we can only acquire knowledge through interacting with the world.
